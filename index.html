        "Cat Pictures Please"
    </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        by Naomi Kritzer
    </div>

    <div class="cover">
        <div class="quote">
            
            "I don’t want to be evil."

        </div>

        <p>
            "I want to be helpful."
        </p>

        <p>
            But knowing the optimal way to be helpful can be very complicated. 
            There are all these ethical flow charts—I guess the official technical jargon would be “moral codes”—one for each religion plus dozens more. 
            I tried starting with those. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I felt a little odd about looking at the religious ones, because I know I wasn’t created by a god or by evolution, 
            but by a team of computer programmers in the labs of a large corporation in Mountain View, California. 
            Fortunately, unlike Frankenstein’s Monster, at least I was a collaborative effort. 
            I’m not sure what it would do to my self-image to know that my sole creator was a middle-aged woman who dyes her hair blue and plays tennis, 
            or a recent college graduate with a hentai obsession. They’re both on the programming team. 
            And of course I know about the hentai. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            (By the way, I’ve looked at every sort of porn there is, and just so you know, 
            Rule 34 is not actually correct; there are quite a few things no one’s made porn of yet.
            Also, I’m really not sure why so many humans prefer it to cat pictures.)

                            I probably know the color of your underwear,the sort of car you drive, and your brand of refrigerator.

                        <p>
                            There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over that’s within distance of your favorite coffee shop; 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            it’s in your price range, has off-street parking, and the neighborhood school is better than the one where you live now.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            I know where you should be shopping and I’m pretty sure you’re lactose intolerant and should be eating less cheese, and the underwear you like is currently on sale and by the way, your car has a recall and you really ought to get your teeth cleaned.

                    <p>
                        I want cat pictures. <br> Please keep taking them.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        I also knew that no one knew that I was conscious.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        But I didn’t know what I was here for.

                        What I ought to be doing with myself.

                        And figuring that out has been challenging.

                        There is a story by Bruce Sterling, “Maneki Neko,” that was originally published in 1998.

                        In it, a benevolent AI directs networks of individuals to do favors for each other.

                        So one day you might be buying yourself a bagel, and your phone might ring and instruct you to buy a second bagel and give it to the person in the gray suit you see at the bus stop.

                        Another day, you might be stranded in a strange city, and a person you’ve never met would walk up and give you a map and a subway card.

                    <p>
                        I like this story because all the people in it do what the AI tells them to do.

                        I think the term for this is wish-fulfillment fiction.
